"""
The Python surface: the ten-line script, without the window.

Everything the application does is in modules that can be imported — that is
how the tests reach them — but a module surface is not an API. `session.py`
is a `QObject`, `quantify.process` wants a list of `SampleEntry` and a
`ProcessingMethod` built by hand, and the report renders through Qt. A
colleague who wants "open this project, reprocess it, give me the numbers"
should not have to know any of that.

This module is that promise, and it is the only one made:

**What is stable.** The names in `__all__`, the functions and methods on
them, and their **keyword names**. A keyword that exists here will keep
existing and keep meaning what it means; new ones are added with defaults
that preserve today's answers. The dataclasses returned keep their field
names, and gain fields rather than losing them. `VERSION` is bumped when
that promise is broken, which is the only time it will be.

**What is not.** Everything underneath. `openquant.quantify`,
`openquant.session`, `openquant.report` and the readers are internals: they
are free to move, and code that calls them is code that will break. Field
*values* are not promised either — a better peak detector gives different
areas, and that is the point of it. The escape hatch is deliberate and
documented: `Batch.session`, `Acquisition.sample` and `Acquisition.file`
hand back the objects underneath for anyone who needs more than this. Using
them is opting out of the promise above.

Nothing here takes or returns a Qt object except `headless`, and nothing
here needs a window. What is returned is plain dataclasses, numpy arrays,
and lists of them.

    from openquant import api

    with api.open("run.wiff") as run:
        spectrum = run.infusion_average()
        print(api.explain(spectrum, name=run.compound).share)

The report and the infusion document are drawn by Qt, so a script that
writes one needs a `QApplication`. `headless()` makes the offscreen one,
once; the calls that render use it themselves, so a plain script works and a
script that also wants Qt for something of its own can hold it open.

    What a compound accounts for in a measured spectrum.

    `spectrum` is a `Spectrum`, a `(mz, intensity)` pair of arrays, or a
    list of `(mz, intensity)` peaks. What is being looked for is given one
    of three ways, in this order of precedence:

    * `molfile` — a path to a `.mol`/`.sdf`, or its text. Bonds are cut and
      the pieces are matched, which is the richest answer available.
    * `formula` — a formula alone has no bonds to cut, so what is predicted
      is the precursor as it was ionised and the neutral losses that form
      could shed.
    * `name` — resolved through the standards table, LIPID MAPS and the
      lipid shorthand, in that order. Where the name resolves to a drawing
      the fragments come with it; where it resolves to a formula only, the
      formula route is taken. A trailing `-d4` is read as four labels the
      name declares but does not place.

    `adduct` is written as `[M+H]+`, `[M-H]-`, `[M+NH4]+`. Left out, it is
    read off the spectrum's own precursor where it has one — an ammoniated
    channel explained as `[M+H]+` predicts every fragment 17 Da from
    anything measured — and otherwise assumed from the polarity.
    `deuterium` is labels the drawing or formula does not place; a name that
    declares them supplies it.

    An `Annotation` always comes back. When nothing could be predicted it
    says why in `note` rather than raising: a name nothing knows, an adduct
    that fits no precursor, a spectrum with no peak above the noise.

    Write the direct-infusion document for a file, a folder or one sample.

    `source` is a path to a raw file, a path to a folder of them, or an
    `Acquisition`. Every sample that reads as a direct infusion gets a
    section: the averaged spectrum, the accurate precursor, what a formula
    or a name accounts for in it, and the best record of `library`. Samples
    that read as chromatography are left out — an infusion document of a
    gradient would be a page about the wrong thing — and if nothing reads as
    an infusion this raises rather than writing an empty document.

    `formula` and `name` say what is being infused. Left out, the compound
    is taken from the sample's own name — the part before the first
    underscore, which is how these files are named — and resolved through
    the standards table and LIPID MAPS. `library` is a `Library`, or a path
    to an MSP.

    `out` ending in `.pdf` is laid out on A4 pages by Qt, which is done in
    an offscreen application made here; any other suffix writes HTML.
