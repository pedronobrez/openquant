"""
What was changed by hand: when, to what, from what to what.

Everything a batch is processed with is saved with the project — the method,
the integration parameters, the calibration. What is not saved anywhere is
the sequence of decisions a person made on top of that: this peak integrated
by hand, that standard dropped from the curve, this injection retyped as a
blank. Reopening a project six months later shows the answer and not how it
was arrived at.

The trail is that record. It is append-only: nothing here edits or deletes an
entry, and no interface is offered for doing so. It is saved in the project
under `audit` and read back; a project written before this existed has no key
and loads with an empty trail, which is the truthful answer for it rather
than a fabricated one.

It is **not** a regulated audit trail. There are no user accounts, no
electronic signatures and no tamper evidence: the project is a JSON file that
anyone can edit in a text editor. What it gives is the provenance of the
numbers for the person reviewing them, which is a different and smaller
claim — see the manual's *Audit trail* page.

Values are recorded as they were shown to the user and kept short: the point
is a line that reads at a glance, not a serialisation of the object.
