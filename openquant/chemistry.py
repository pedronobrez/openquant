"""
Elemental composition tools: formula parsing, exact masses, isotope patterns,
mass accuracy, formula finding, and the lipid shorthand read both ways — a
name into a formula (`formula_from_name`) and a mass back into the names that
carry it (`names_for_mass`).

Masses are monoisotopic unless stated otherwise. Abundances come from the
IUPAC 2013 representative isotopic compositions.

An adduct here is more than an offset. It also says what becomes of the
charge when the ion breaks up, because that is what decides which masses a
product spectrum can hold, and getting it wrong is not a rounding error — it
moves every predicted fragment by 17 Da:

- **A proton adduct** (`[M+H]+`, `[M-H]-`, `[M+2H]2+`) keeps its charge on
  whichever piece holds it. The fragments are the protonated — or
  deprotonated — pieces, which is what the enumerator already assumes.
- **A labile adduct** (`[M+NH4]+`, and in negative mode `[M+HCOO]-`,
  `[M+CH3COO]-`, `[M+Cl]-`) is held by hydrogen bonds and nothing stronger.
  It leaves as a neutral — ammonia, formic acid, acetic acid, hydrogen
  chloride — and hands over a proton on the way, so the ion that fragments
  is `[M+H]+` (or `[M-H]-`) and every fragment carries that, not the adduct.
  This is why an ammoniated precursor at 430.35 shows a ladder starting at
  413.32 and nothing at all 17 Da higher: `[M+NH4-H2O]+` is not a species,
  because the ammonia is long gone before a hydroxyl leaves.
- **A metal adduct** (`[M+Na]+`, `[M+K]+`) is a coordinate bond, and the
  metal stays on the piece that keeps the coordinating site — which the
  arithmetic cannot know. Both are therefore offered, `[piece+Na]+` and
  `[piece+H]+`, and each ion says which was assumed.

`identify_adduct` runs this backwards: given a formula and the precursor the
method was written with, it says which adduct that number *is*, with the
error, and refuses rather than guessing when nothing fits.

    Names whose formula matches this mass, for when the name is the mistake.

    `components.precursor_repairs` finds a written precursor its name's
    formula contradicts and offers to overwrite the mass. Where the two are a
    whole dalton or more apart that is the wrong repair: the instrument
    acquired the mass that was written, so it is the *name* that is wrong, and
    this is what says what it might have been.

    Two lists come back, the class's first and the database's after it, every
    row carrying `in_class` to say which it is:

    - names built out of the written name's own class — same head group, same
      base, the same number of chains — with the chains moved within
      `NAME_SEARCH_CARBONS` and `NAME_SEARCH_DOUBLE_BONDS`, the hydroxyls
      moved, and the sphingoid base's `d`/`t`/`m` varied. These are ranked by
      how little of the written name they change, nearest first: a name that
      differs by one double bond is a correction, and one that differs by
      three chains and a hydroxyl is a coincidence.
    - what LIPID MAPS holds at the same mass, which is where a name outside
      the class comes from. Grouped by species, because a mass search answers
      a species and never a compound.

    `tolerance` is in Da and defaults to `NAME_MASS_TOLERANCE`, which is the
    nominal mass and not the written one — see the constant for why. Nothing
    is offered that the mass does not support, so an empty list is a real
    answer, and on the real method it is the commonest one: a disagreement of
    a whole odd dalton cannot be a chain at all. A chain moves the mass by
    14 Da, a double bond by 2 and a hydroxyl by 16, so nothing this class can
    be reaches a mass 1 Da away — the name is not off by a chain, the number
    is off by a digit, and the class has nothing to say about it.
