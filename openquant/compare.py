"""
What a batch's numbers owe to the algorithm that integrated them.

A peak area is a measurement and a decision: where the peak begins and ends,
and what is done with the points in between. Two attempts at reproducing the
vendor's own boundary rule are in this project's history and both were
wrong, and a single change to where the detector may look made 894 rows of a
real batch appear from nothing. If the number moves that much with a
processing decision, the size of that movement is part of the result.

This runs the same batch through every algorithm and puts the answers side
by side, per component: how many rows each one found, how far the areas
sit from the reference, and how well each repeated itself on the things that
were meant to repeat — the internal standards, spiked into every vial at one
amount, and the quality controls. That last figure is the one that can say
an algorithm is better rather than merely different: same files, same noise,
same instrument, only the arithmetic changed.
