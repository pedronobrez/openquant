"""
Components of a processing method — the equivalent of MultiQuant's component
table.

A component says what to extract (precursor, fragment, tolerance), where the
peak is expected (retention time and half window), and how its result is
reported (raw area, ratio to an internal standard, or a concentration read off
a calibration curve).

It may also say what it is *made of*. `Component.formula` with an adduct is
the only thing that gives a component a true mass — the written precursor is
somebody's rounding, good to a few hundred ppm — and a true mass is what
`recalibrate.py` needs before an internal standard can be a lock mass.
Methods do not carry formulas, but they do carry names, and a lipid name in
shorthand says the composition outright. So `fill_formulas` reads
`chemistry.formulas_from_name` into the empty Formula cells and **checks
every one against the precursor already written down**, to that precursor's
own last decimal: a formula that disagrees is reported and dropped, because a
wrong formula is a wrong lock mass, which is worse than no lock mass.

On the real 141-component method: 125 filled and 10 of its 11 internal
standards, in milliseconds and without opening a file. Thirteen of the 16
refusals were the written precursor typed to fewer places than it deserved,
and `precursor_repairs` below is how those are corrected — deliberately, one
row at a time. The other three are a whole dalton or more out, and the batch
says the instrument acquired the mass as written, which puts the *name* in
question instead: a repair there would take the component off the channel its
data is on.
