"""
What is about to be opened, looked at before anything opens it.

Opening a file is where a folder's problems are found today, and by then
the answer is already wrong: a `.wiff` whose `.wiff.scan` is not beside it
opens and draws its chromatograms, a `.wiff2` looks like data and is not
read here, a file picked twice becomes two entries of one injection. None
of that needs a reader. The names in the folder say it, and this module
reads names, sizes nothing and opens nothing — `check_files` touches the
file system only through `listdir`, `exists` and `access`.

Everything it finds is a `Finding`: what was seen, in plain words, and
what to do about it. The one repair it can propose is a rename, because
the ordinary way a SCIEX pair comes apart is a companion renamed by hand
(`name.wiff_mix1.scan` beside `name_mix1.wiff`), and the file the reader
needs is then in the folder under the wrong name. Which stray belongs to
which `.wiff` cannot be *known* from outside the files — the sizes say
nothing, both are large — so the pairing is by the names alone and is
reported as a guess. `apply_rename` never overwrites.
