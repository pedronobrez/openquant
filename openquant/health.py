"""
What the method itself will fail at, before a batch is processed.

Everything reported here was found by hand on a real method over the course
of a day, and every one of them is mechanically detectable: eighty-two
components with no retention time, twenty-four sharing a transition with
nothing to separate them, an internal standard for a third of the panel with
no time of its own, windows narrower than the sampling can resolve.

None of it is about the data being bad. It is about the method asking for
something the acquisition cannot deliver, which is a different problem and
has a different fix — and one worth learning about before a batch is
processed rather than from the results afterwards.

The checks that need a batch open are skipped without one and say so, rather
than passing quietly.
