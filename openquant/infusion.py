"""
Telling a direct infusion from a chromatographic run, from the sample alone.

In an infusion there is no column. The analyte is sprayed for a minute or two
and every scan is the same spectrum plus noise, so the chromatogram carries no
information and the thing worth looking at is the average of the whole run. In
a chromatographic run the opposite holds: the ion current is concentrated into
peaks, and a spectrum only means something over one of them.

The verdict is two figures of the same shape, and nothing else:

`above_half`
    the fraction of the sample's total ion chromatogram sitting at or above
    half its own maximum.
`channel_above_half`
    the same measure on the one channel the average would be shown from —
    the product-ion channel carrying the most signal, or the survey when the
    method has no product scan.

That "maximum" is the **99th percentile** of the scans that are left after
the first `SETTLING_SECONDS` of acquisition, not the largest of them. See
*The spike that inverted the two populations* below: the largest scan is one
scan, and on three of nine real infusions it was two to four times the median
and dragged both figures to 0.002 – 0.006, under every chromatographic run
measured. The settling window is the same finding on a short run, where one
per cent of the scans is one scan again — see *Short runs* below, and
`MIN_JUDGED_SCANS`, which is where the verdict says it cannot tell.

A peak is by definition narrow against the run it sits in, so a run with a
peak in it spends most of its scans well under half the apex; a spray that
merely drifts stays above it from the first scan to the last. Both have to be
flat. The sample total alone is not enough — a scheduled method acquires each
transition over its own window, and the sum of many peaks at different times
is flatter than any of them — and one channel alone is not enough either,
since a single transition of a blank is flat because it is empty. Neither
statistic reads a spectrum, so the verdict costs one chromatogram per channel,
works on a `.wiff` whose `.wiff.scan` is missing, and says the same thing
about a file and about its mzML.

The spike that inverted the two populations
-------------------------------------------

The first version of this module took the largest scan as the maximum, and
was written with only the chromatographic population measured. When the nine
bile-acid infusions were finally read, **three of the nine measured 0.0021,
0.0039 and 0.0063 on both figures** — lower than every one of the thirty-nine
chromatographic runs. The two populations were not merely overlapping, they
were the wrong way round, and no value of `FLAT_FRACTION` separates them.

The cause is one scan. All three carry a transient at scan index 1, 0.0084 min
in, of 2.8 to 4.4 times the run's median total; `DCA-d4_TOFMSMS_Mix1` carries
two more mid-run, at 1.08 and 1.10 min. Half of a spike is above everything
else in the run, so a perfectly flat spray measured as though nothing in it
ever reached half its own height. The statistic was wrong, not the threshold.

So the reference is the **99th percentile** of the scans, `REFERENCE_PERCENTILE`,
rather than the largest of them. The choice is measured, not assumed:

| reference | infusions (9) | chromatographic (39) | margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| the largest scan | 0.0021 – 1.0000 | 0.0041 – 0.0984 | **−0.096**, inverted |
| 99.5th percentile | 0.6385 – 1.0000 | 0.0061 – 0.0984 | +0.540 |
| **99th percentile** | **0.9937 – 1.0000** | **0.0143 – 0.1148** | **+0.879** |
| 95th percentile | 0.9937 – 1.0000 | 0.0714 – 0.2623 | +0.731 |
| 90th percentile | 0.9937 – 1.0000 | 0.1148 – 0.4098 | +0.584 |

(each figure the smaller of the two the verdict reads). 99.5 is not enough
because `DCA-d4_TOFMSMS_Mix1`'s three spiked scans are 0.63% of its 473; the
widest margin measured is 0.895 at the 99.2nd percentile and 99 is the round
number next to it. Going lower costs margin from the other end, because
setting aside a real peak's apex lifts the chromatographic figures too.

Short runs: the settling window and the floor
---------------------------------------------

The paragraph that used to stand here said that below about a hundred scans
the 99th percentile is the largest scan again, and left it as a stated gap.
It was then measured, by truncating all forty-eight acquisitions to their
first 20, 30, 50, 75 and 100 scans and reading both figures off the shortened
run. The gap is real, it is wider than "about a hundred", and it has a second
half nobody had looked for.

**Where the 99th percentile breaks** — the smaller of the two figures, worst
and best of each population. A file appears at a length only if it has that
many scans, which is why the twenty-six 14.6-minute runs (61 scans each) drop
out past 50:

| first N scans | files | infusions (9) | chromatographic |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | 48 | **0.0500** – 1.0000 | 0.0000 – 0.9500 (39) |
| 30 | 48 | **0.0333** – 1.0000 | 0.0345 – 0.9667 (39) |
| 50 | 48 | **0.0200** – 1.0000 | 0.0204 – 0.6735 (39) |
| 75 | 22 | **0.3333** – 1.0000 | 0.0270 – 0.8919 (13) |
| 100 | 22 | 0.9900 – 1.0000 | 0.0202 – 0.9394 (13) |
| the whole run | 48 | 0.9937 – 1.0000 | 0.0143 – 0.1148 (39) |

The break is the same three spiked infusions as before, for the same reason:
`np.percentile` interpolates, so at 50 scans the 99th percentile sits about
half way from the second largest scan to the largest and a 4.4× transient
takes the reference with it. The populations are inverted again — margin
−0.900 at 20 scans, −0.654 at 50 — and it holds to 80 scans, not to 100.

**And the second half.** Every one of those lengths also has a
chromatographic run reading 0.93 – 1.00, because a gradient cut off before
anything elutes is flat, and flat is the whole of what these two figures
measure. At 20 scans the current rule calls seven of forty-eight wrong: three
infusions read as chromatographic, and **four chromatographic runs read as
infusions**.

**The rule.** Every candidate was scored by its margin — worst infusion minus
worst chromatographic run, both on the smaller figure — at every length:

| reference | 20 | 30 | 50 | 75 | 100 | whole run |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 99th percentile (before) | −0.900 | −0.933 | −0.654 | −0.559 | +0.051 | +0.879 |
| largest scan, first second dropped | 0.000 | 0.000 | +0.521 | +0.384 | +0.418 | **−0.096** |
| median of the top ⌈1%⌉+2 scans | +0.050 | 0.000 | +0.082 | +0.054 | +0.051 | +0.879 |
| the same, first second dropped | 0.000 | 0.000 | +0.104 | +0.069 | +0.061 | +0.877 |
| **99th percentile, first second dropped** | 0.000 | 0.000 | **+0.313** | **+0.110** | **+0.061** | **+0.877** |

So the simplest honest rule is the one that wins: keep the percentile and
drop the first `SETTLING_SECONDS` of acquisition, which is where the
transient is — scan 1, 0.0084 min, at a quarter-second cycle. The two
alternatives were measured and both fail somewhere. Dropping the first second
*alone*, with the largest scan back as the reference, fails at full length:
`DCA-d4_TOFMSMS_Mix1` carries two more bursts at 1.08 and 1.10 min, which no
settling window reaches, and it reads **0.0043**. And the median of the top
⌈1% of n⌉+2 scans — a reference tied to the run's length, which is the other
obvious way to make the top robust — survives one spike anywhere but not
three: on that same file truncated to 300 scans, where all three bursts are
in and k is 5, the median of the top five *is* a burst and the file reads
**0.0100**.

With the first second dropped the infusion side stops moving with the length
at all — 1.0000 at every truncation from 20 scans to 250, 0.9936 on the whole
run:

| first N scans | infusions (9) | chromatographic |
|---|---|---|
| 20 | 1.0000 – 1.0000 | 0.0000 – 1.0000 (39) |
| 30 | 1.0000 – 1.0000 | 0.0357 – 1.0000 (39) |
| 50 | 1.0000 – 1.0000 | 0.0208 – 0.6875 (39) |
| 75 | 1.0000 – 1.0000 | 0.0274 – 0.8904 (13) |
| 100 | 1.0000 – 1.0000 | 0.0211 – 0.9388 (13) |
| the whole run | 0.9936 – 1.0000 | 0.0145 – 0.1167 (39) |

**The floor.** The right-hand column is the part no reference statistic
fixes, and it is why `MIN_JUDGED_SCANS` exists. `260904_EICs_Isabela_S001`'s
total ion chromatogram is empty until 8.9 minutes in. Truncated to its first
100 scans it reads **1.0000 on the sample total and 0.9388 on its strongest
channel** — an infusion's signature exactly, on a gradient. No statistic on a
chromatogram separates those, because there is nothing there to separate:
both are a flat line. Read scan by scan that file is flat to 107 scans
(4.08 min), not flat from 108 to 153, flat again from 154 to 234
(5.84 – 8.93 min), and never after 235.

So **0.75 does not separate the two populations at any length below 240
scans**. That is the measured floor and it is above the shortest real
infusion, which has 146 scans, so putting the floor there would refuse a
genuine call. The floor goes where the rest of the measurement supports it:
**apart from that one file, no chromatographic run of the thirty-nine reads
flat past 35 scans**, and the shortest infusion has 146, so
`MIN_JUDGED_SCANS` is **120** — clear of 35 by a wide margin and 26 scans
below 146. S001's second stretch is above 120 and no floor that keeps the
146-scan infusion can reach it; that is stated rather than fixed.

The floor gates the flat answer only, never the other one. A run that shows
structure is chromatographic at any length — that is a positive finding, and
it is what keeps the twenty-six 61-scan runs reading "chromatographic" with
their figures rather than "too short to tell". A run that shows none is an
infusion only when there is enough of it for "none" to mean something. With
that, and the settling window (**wrong** is a verdict of the other kind, not
a refusal):

| first N scans | files | before: inf / chrom / **wrong** | after: inf / chrom / **wrong** / too short |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | 48 | 6 / 35 / **7** | 0 / 35 / **0** / 13 |
| 30 | 48 | 6 / 35 / **7** | 0 / 35 / **0** / 13 |
| 50 | 48 | 6 / 39 / **3** | 0 / 39 / **0** / 9 |
| 75 | 22 | 7 / 12 / **3** | 0 / 12 / **0** / 10 |
| 100 | 22 | 9 / 12 / **1** | 0 / 12 / **0** / 10 |
| 120 | 22 | 9 / 13 / **0** | 9 / 13 / **0** / 0 |
| 200 | 21 | 8 / 12 / **1** | 8 / 12 / **1** / 0 |
| the whole run | 48 | 9 / 39 / **0** | 9 / 39 / **0** / 0 |

The floor is bought with a real loss and it is on that table: a genuine
infusion of fewer than 120 scans reads 1.0000 on both figures and is refused
anyway. None of the nine to hand is that short. The single row where the new
rule is still wrong is 200 scans, and it is S001 inside its flat stretch —
the case the floor cannot reach. At ten scans the settling window cannot be
taken at all (fewer than `MIN_SCANS` would be left) and the three spiked
infusions read chromatographic; below the floor nothing is called an infusion
anyway, so nothing turns on it.

Measured
--------

Forty-eight acquisitions, everything to hand, read through `openquant.raw`,
whole runs, with the reference at the 99th percentile of the scans left after
the settling window:

| acquisition set | n | `above_half` | `channel_above_half` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/Volumes/NOBRE/Cyborg/Bileomics/*` — ZenoTOF 7600, 0.6 – 2.0 min, 146 – 473 scans, product-ion infusions of bile-acid standards, negative | 9 | 0.9936 – 1.0000 | 0.9936 – 1.0000 |
| `260904_EICs_Isabela_*` — TripleTOF 5600, 21.4 min, 577 scans, 81 channels, MRM-HR | 5 | 0.019 – 0.057 | 0.030 – 0.097 |
| `20.02.21_Esfing_Zeca_Unicamp_*` — TripleTOF 5600, 14.6 min, 61 scans, 144 channels | 26 | 0.033 – 0.433 | 0.017 – 0.383 |
| `260406-Teste-*` — ZenoTOF 7600, 24.0 min, 482 – 490 scans, 25 channels, DIA | 8 | 0.031 – 0.364 | 0.015 – 0.060 |

**Nothing is miscalled: 9 infusions and 39 chromatographic runs, 48 of 48.**
The runs with the least chromatography in them are still caught by the second
figure rather than the first. `260406-Teste-Eq01` is a column equilibration
with no injection at all — solvent spraying for 24 minutes, the nearest thing
in the set to an infusion — and measures 0.364 on the sample total against
0.060 on its strongest channel. `20.02.21_Esfing_Zeca_Unicamp_08`, at 0.383 on
its strongest channel, measures 0.050 on the sample total. Across the
thirty-nine the smaller of the two figures never exceeds **0.1167**, and across
the nine infusions it never falls below **0.9936**. `FLAT_FRACTION = 0.75`
therefore sits 0.633 above the worst chromatographic run and 0.244 below the
worst infusion, inside a gap of 0.877. The maximum-margin cut would be 0.555;
0.75 is kept because it is already inside the gap, it is the figure the manual
states, and moving it would change verdicts on nothing measured.

The same forty-eight without the settling window — that is, the rule as it
stood before short runs were measured — give 0.9937 – 1.0000 and a
chromatographic worst of 0.1148, a gap of 0.879. Dropping a second off the
front of every trace therefore costs 0.002 of margin on whole runs and buys
everything in the section above.

Three other candidate rules were measured and are not used:

*Scan-to-scan spectral correlation.* The cosine between the average spectrum
of the first fifth of a run and that of the last fifth, binned at 0.1 Da, was
expected to be low for chromatography and near one for an infusion. On the
survey channel it behaves: 0.004 – 0.79 over the same thirty-nine files. On
the **product-ion** channel — the channel an infusion is actually shown from —
it does not: the five `260904_EICs_Isabela_*` runs measure 0.847, 0.933,
0.987, 0.990 and 0.992, because a single MRM-HR transition sees the same near
empty background at both ends of a gradient. A rule that would have to be told
which channel to look at, and that answers 0.99 for a chromatographic run on
the channel that matters, is worse than not having it.

*Coefficient of variation of the total ion chromatogram.* 0.398 – 1.493 over
the same files, the low end being a blank. An infusion whose spray falls by a
third over the run — ordinary — lands close enough to 0.4 that there is no
margin to place a threshold in, and the measure punishes drift, which is not
what is being asked.

*Absence of any peak-shaped feature.* `processing.detect_peaks` on a
synthetic flat trace of 1,000 counts with 3% noise returns three peaks, of
106, 93 and 87 counts. That is the documented behaviour rather than a
surprise — a flat trace gives `estimate_noise` nothing to measure, so
detection falls back to `NOISE_FLOOR` and gates on absolute height — but it
makes "no peak was detected" the wrong question to ask of an infusion.

Getting the verdict wrong stays cheap by design: it only decides what the
Explorer shows first, every channel and every range stays reachable by hand,
`Average whole run` gives the same view on any sample, and the default
whenever anything cannot be measured is "not an infusion", which is what the
application did before this module existed.

    Which scans of an infusion the spray was steady for.

    An electrospray is not steady for the whole of a run. It arcs, a droplet
    reaches the cone, the needle wets: the total ion current leaves the level
    it was holding for a few scans and comes back. Averaged in with everything
    else, those scans are a few tenths of a per cent of a two-minute run and
    move nothing — but they are not what the compound looks like, and one of
    them is a fifth of the whole run's ion current.

    A scan is unstable when its total departs from the running median of
    `window` scans by more than `jump`; the scans after it stay unstable until
    the total is back inside `recovered`. Both figures were measured on nine
    real infusions and both sit in a plateau — see the constants.

    **Why the total and not the base peak.** The reader offers `bpc()` for the
    same price as `tic()` and it was measured beside it. It is four to eight
    times the noisier: on the six infusions with no burst at all the base peak
    departs from its own running median by up to 0.585 where the total never
    passes 0.164, so any threshold that catches a burst on the base peak also
    catches ordinary scans on a spray that never faltered. And it finds
    nothing new — every scan it flags on the two files that do burst, the
    total flags too. So the mask reads the total, and says so here rather than
    reading both and hoping.

    **The first second.** `SETTLING_SECONDS` is not applied. It exists because
    a *percentile* sets aside a share of the scans and on a short run that
    share is one scan; this measures each scan against its neighbours instead,
    and the transient at scan 1 comes out at 4.5, 5.1 and 5.0 times its
    baseline on the three files that carry one — thirteen times the widest
    ordinary departure measured. Dropping four scans of every run to catch
    what is already caught would be throwing away data no measurement objects
    to, which on the shortest infusion to hand is 2.7% of it.

    A run with no baseline to speak of — fewer than `MIN_SCANS` — keeps every
    scan and says why in `note`. So does a channel that cannot be read.

    The noise floor of an infusion's averaged spectrum, measured two ways.

    A fixed floor is a guess about an instrument. `precursor.MIN_INTENSITY`
    is 100 counts and it was written for a survey scan of a chromatographic
    run — one scan, on a TripleTOF. An infusion's spectrum is the
    average of every scan of the run, and an average has neither the units
    nor the noise of one scan.

    So it is measured, from the acquisition itself, two ways that fail
    differently. Both are reported and the larger is taken.

    **(a) The empty mass regions of the averaged profile spectrum.** Every
    centroid at or above `min_relative` of the base peak is found and half a
    dalton either side of it set aside (`processing.NOISE_EXCLUDE_DA`); what
    is left is between the isotope clusters and away from every peak. The
    median, the median absolute deviation and the 99th percentile of the
    measured points there describe the background, and the 99th percentile
    of the *local maxima* among them is the height a noise peak reaches —
    which is the one the floor is taken from, since what it gates is the
    tallest point of a window and not a point drawn at random. Both are on
    the record. Points of exactly zero are left out, so a reader that
    restores a vendor's stripped zeros and one that does not give the same
    answer.

    **(b) The scan-to-scan scatter of a quiet mass window.** The quietest
    window `width` wide that holds no peak at all is extracted over the whole
    run — the same window in every scan — and the standard
    deviation of its summed intensity taken between scans. Averaging n scans
    divides noise by the root of n, so that standard deviation is divided by
    it in turn; the record keeps both numbers, because what n bought is the
    interesting half. (a) can only see what is left after averaging; (b)
    reads the averaging itself.

    The floor is never invented: where neither estimate can be made the
    record says so and carries `precursor.MIN_INTENSITY`, which is what
    stood here before. Where the measurement comes out under that constant
    the measurement is used and `quieter_than_fixed` says so.

    Measured
    --------

    The nine ZenoTOF 7600 bile-acid infusions (positive, one product-ion
    channel each, no survey scan), each averaged over its whole run. `n` is
    the scans averaged, and every intensity is in the units of that average:

    | acquisition | n | base peak | (a) | (b) | floor |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | `CA-d4_…12CE…TESTEARTIGO` | 294 | 109 | 0.068 | 0.026 | **0.068** |
    | `CA-d4_…12CE…mix1` | 244 | 12,271 | 3.53 | 0.130 | **3.53** |
    | `CA-d4_…22CE…TESTEARTIGO` | 311 | 234 | 0.129 | 0.040 | **0.129** |
    | `CA-d4_…22CE…mix1` | 146 | 9,618 | 3.12 | 0.357 | **3.12** |
    | `CA-d4_Mix1` CID 45 eV | 473 | 5,673 | 0.962 | 0.232 | **0.962** |
    | `DCA-d4_…22CE…mix1` | 473 | 9,151 | 2.67 | 0.179 | **2.67** |
    | `DCA-d4_Mix1` CID 40 eV | 473 | 3,109 | 0.583 | 0.172 | **0.583** |
    | `TDCA-d4_…22CE…mix1` | 468 | 5,235 | 1.47 | 0.111 | **1.47** |
    | `TDCA-d4_Mix1` CID 30 eV | 257 | 9,044 | 2.45 | 0.253 | **2.45** |

    **(a) is the larger on nine of nine**, by 2.6 to 27 times, so
    the choice never fell to (b) on these files — but (b) is what says the
    averaging worked: one scan's window scatters by 0.45 to 5.05 counts and
    the average of 146 to 473 of them by 0.026 to 0.36, a factor of 12 to 22,
    which is the root of n to within the width of the estimate. The two
    percentiles of (a) agree on six of the nine and differ on three, most
    where the background is nearly all of the spectrum: peaks 0.068 against
    points 0.058, 0.129 against 0.119, and 0.583 against 0.570.

    Against the fixed 100 counts, every one of the nine is quieter — by a
    factor of 28 on the loudest and 1,500 on the quietest. The floor decides
    the precursor read off the average, and there it moves **four** of the
    nine from *too little to measure* to a measurement: 84 counts on
    `CA-d4_Mix1` is 88 times its floor, and 33 on `DCA-d4_Mix1` is 57 times
    its own. What those four then measure is a different matter and not this
    function's:
    they come out at −30 to −70 ppm from the written precursor and none of
    them joins the four already inside 25 ppm. The height says a peak is
    there; the mass says whether it is the compound.

    Twelve chromatographic acquisitions for contrast, on a different
    instrument and a real gradient: a TripleTOF 5600, 81 channels each, the
    strongest product-ion channel of every one averaged over the boundaries
    of its own largest peak — 3 to 67 scans, peaks of 352 to 590,000 counts.
    Eleven of the twelve are measured, at (a) 0.69 to 20.1 counts against (b)
    0.23 to 3.25, **(a) the larger on eleven of eleven** as it was on the
    infusions, so the floor is 0.69 to 20.1. The loudest of them,
    `260904_…5E_003` on `TOF PI 325.20 -> 50-330, CE -45`, averages the 13
    scans of a peak 567,000 counts tall and comes out at **20.1 counts** —
    three hundred times the quietest infusion's, because thirteen scans
    averaged is not four hundred, and the fixed 100 was still five times too
    strict.

    The twelfth is the fallback firing on real data rather than in a test.
    `260903_…Cal001`'s strongest product channel holds a peak of 352 counts
    over three scans; the average of those three has 167 measured points in
    412 and no empty region wide enough to measure in, so neither estimate
    can be made, `measured` is False, and the fixed 100 counts stands with
    the reason on the record. A quiet acquisition and an acquisition with
    nothing in it are not the same thing, and only one of them gets a
    measurement.

    The limit, stated rather than fixed: this is one number for a whole
    spectrum and a background is not the same at every mass. On the two
    acquisitions of the nine that hold nothing at all, the empty regions are
    the high-mass end where the detector saw nothing, so the floor lands at
    0.068 and 0.129 counts while the chemical background peaks at a hundred
    — and a peak above this floor is a peak above the background, which is
    not the same claim as a peak that is the compound.

    It costs one averaged spectrum and one extracted chromatogram: 0.5 to
    1.7 s a file on those nine, opening included, and `noise_floor_for` remembers it per
    channel so the pane, the report and a record written from the spectrum
    pay for it once.

    `spectrum` is `(mz, intensity)` when the caller already holds the
    average — the report and the Explorer both do, and reading a quarter of
    a million profile points again costs seconds. The chromatogram of the
    quiet window is still read from the channel: it is the run scan by scan,
    which no averaged spectrum carries.

    `scans` is how many scans that handed-in average was taken over, where
    it is not simply every scan of the range. The report averages the stable
    stretch of the spray and leaves the rest out, so counting the range would
    divide (b) by the root of a number of scans the spectrum does not
    contain. It changes only what (b) says and what `describe` prints, since
    (a) has been the larger on every acquisition measured — but a sentence
    reading "473 scans averaged" under a spectrum averaged from 400 of them
    would be false, and the estimate would be optimistic by the ratio of the
    roots.
