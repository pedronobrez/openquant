"""
A folder of infusions, reported without opening one of them in the Explorer.

The per-compound report answers *is this vial what the label says it is?* for
the sample on screen, and the Infusions tab answers it for everything already
open. Both start with somebody opening files. A folder that came off the
instrument this morning has nine acquisitions in it and the question asked of
it is the same nine times, so this asks it with no window and no tree: point
at the folder, get the document.

What it does, in order
----------------------

1. `folder.check_files` looks the paths over before anything is opened — a
   `.wiff` whose `.wiff.scan` is not beside it, a `.wiff2` nothing here
   reads, a file given twice. Every finding is carried through to the caller
   and printed, and **a `.wiff` missing its companion is never opened**: it
   would open, draw its chromatograms and have no spectra, and a report whose
   averaged spectrum is empty is a page that says nothing at length.
2. Each remaining file is opened into a `Session` **of its own**, measured,
   and closed again before the next is opened. A folder of thirty infusions
   would otherwise hold thirty readers, each with a memory-mapped `.wiff.scan`
   behind it; the reports that come out hold arrays and strings and no reader,
   so nothing is lost by closing.
3. Samples that do not read as an infusion are left out with the figures that
   say so — `infusion.verdict_for`'s reason, which is a measurement of the
   run and not a guess from the file name.
4. What is left goes through `infusion_report.summarise` exactly as the tab
   calls it, one file at a time, and the rows are merged. The one thing that
   cannot be done per file is the score of each infusion against the others of
   its compound: three acquisitions of `CA-d4` in three files are three
   sessions of one row each, and each would call itself the only infusion of
   its compound. `_cross_score` puts that back over the merged rows, with the
   same `score_against` `summarise` uses.

The component table and the library are the two things a headless run cannot
ask a person for. Both are optional and both are named on the command line:
the components from a project or a components CSV, so the compounds can be
explained from their formulas, and an MSP of one's own to search. Without
either, the rows say why the cell is empty, which is what they do in the tab.
