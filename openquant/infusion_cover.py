"""
The cover that goes in front of a folder of infusions.

`infusion_batch.run` reads nine acquisitions and prints nine sections, each
of which answers *is this vial what the label says it is?* for one vial. Read
back a week later, that document opens on page one of compound one: to find
out what the folder as a whole did you page through it and add the sections
up yourself, which is the arithmetic this file does instead.

It is the chromatographic batch report's front matter, done for infusions —
`report._title_block` names the project and counts the samples, `_findings`
says what a reader should not have to hunt for, and `_contents` says where
everything is. The four blocks here are the same four:

1. **What this is.** The folder, the day, the version of the program, and
   the counts. A document is read detached from whatever made it.
2. **The infusions**, one row each, in `infusion_report.REPORT_COLUMNS` —
   the same row the tab shows and the batch report's *Infusions* section
   prints, so the three cannot disagree — with the compound's acquisitions
   kept together.
3. **What they add up to**, in sentences. Each one sums a column of that
   table and says what it counted against; there is no overall verdict for
   the same reason a per-compound report has none. See `verdict_sentences`.
4. **What was left out**, and **the pages that follow** with their page
   numbers, through `report.print_document`'s own contents machinery: the
   numbers do not exist until the document has been laid out, so the build
   function is called again with them.

The whole thing is one PDF — cover then sections — because a cover in a file
of its own is a file that gets separated from what it covers. `--per-compound`
is the exception and it is asked for explicitly: there the cover is written
on its own, since the pages it introduces are in eight other files.

Nothing here reads a raw file. It is given the `BatchResult` and the
`InfusionSummary` the run already made, and every field it reads off a row it
reads with `getattr`: the row is `infusion_report`'s and grows columns.

#: how far apart two written precursors have to be before they are two ions
#: rather than one typed to fewer places. Cholic acid-d4 is `430.34` in one
#: file of the real folder and `430.35` in another — the same ammonium adduct
#: written twice — while two more files of the same compound write `839.56`,
#: which is not that ion at all. Half a dalton is what `components`
#: (`WHOLE_DALTON`) already uses to separate a typed decimal from a different
#: compound, and the smallest real gap here is four hundred daltons.
SAME_PRECURSOR_DA = 0.5

#: at most this many measured-but-outside errors are given one by one before
#: the sentence gives their range instead. Three fit in a clause; eight are a
#: column of the table above, printed twice.
ERRORS_LISTED = 3

#: the widths the *Infusions* table is printed at. The same twelve columns as
#: the tab and as the batch report's *Infusions* section — `REPORT_COLUMNS`,
#: one definition, so a column added there appears here — but not the same
#: widths: the section's are set for a table read after thirty-nine others,
#: and this one is the first thing on the document.
#:
#: Two rules, both from rendering the nine real infusions and looking at the
#: page. **No heading wraps inside a word.** At the section's widths
#: `Compound`, `Scans` and `Score` came out as `Compoun/d`, `Scan/s` and
#: `Scor/e`, which is `report._table`'s own complaint about a heading; ten,
#: six and six per cent hold them. **No measurement is split.** *Base peak
#: m/z* at seven per cent broke `839.2316` across two lines as `839.23` and
#: `16`, which is worse than any amount of wrapped prose; nine holds it, and
#: `Base peak m/z` then wraps at its space with the `m/z` intact.
#:
#: What pays for those is the four columns that hold a reason rather than a
#: number — *Sample*, *Ions found*, *Library record*, *Other infusions* —
#: which wrap either way and are cut at `CELL_CHARACTERS` first.
COLUMN_WIDTHS = ["10%", "10%", "7%", "6%", "9%", "11%", "8%", "7%", "10%",

#: which of those columns are numbers — `report._infusions`'s own set, since
#: they are its columns
RIGHT_COLUMNS = {3, 4, 9}

#: how much of a cell the cover prints before cutting it at a word.
#: A cell here says why it is empty, and most of those reasons are three
#: words; a few are a whole sentence, and one of the real folder's is 214
#: characters — `CA-d4 is written [M+NH4]+, and 839.56 is none of the adducts
#: of C24H36D4O5 …` — which in a column seven per cent of the page wide is
#: thirty lines of six characters and makes the row most of a page. Rendered
#: and looked at, which is the only way this was ever going to be found: at
#: eighty characters four rows filled a page of the nine, and at forty-eight
#: the whole table is a page and a half. The sentence is not lost: it is
#: written out in full on that compound's own page, which is what the
