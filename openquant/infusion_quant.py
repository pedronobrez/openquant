"""
Quantitation without a column: an analyte against its deuterated standard in
the same spray.

A direct infusion has no chromatography, so there is no peak to integrate and
nothing to put on a time axis. What there is instead is one averaged spectrum
per acquisition holding both compounds at once, and the number that means
something is the ratio of two heights in it. That is the whole of this module:
pick the ions of each compound out of one spectrum, subtract what each puts
into the other, divide, and hand the result to `calibration.py` as an ordinary
row.

Three bases, because they answer different questions
----------------------------------------------------

`responses` measures the same compound three ways and the caller says which
one the ratio is taken on:

`precursor`
    the intact ion the adduct declares — the single most specific number,
    and the first thing to disappear as the collision energy goes up. On the
    three real CID acquisitions it measures **0, 7 and 124 counts**, which is
    nothing, against 5,235 – 12,271 on the four softer ones.
`fragment`
    the component's written fragment where it has one; failing that, the
    strongest ion *this compound* is predicted to give in *this* spectrum;
    and only with no formula at all, the whole spectrum's base peak, whose
    composition nothing knows. The middle case is not a fixed ion, which is
    a hazard rather than a convenience — see `_flag_moving_fragments`. And a
    fragment is silent altogether when the analyte and its standard
    fragment to the *same* piece: that is refused rather than reported (see
    `Ratio.refused`).
`ladder`
    every rung of the water-loss ladder `explain.precursor_ions` predicts,
    summed. On a bile acid under CID this is where the signal actually is:
    the precursor has gone and the intensity is spread over four or five
    dehydrations, so summing them is both the largest number and the most
    stable one against a change of collision energy — 3,839 – 27,754 counts
    over every one of the seven readable acquisitions.

Every ion is measured with its first two isotope peaks (M, M+1, M+2). The
**response** is the monoisotopic peak alone — that is what a concentration is
proportional to — and the satellites are measured because they are what the
correction below is made of.

The cross-talk, and which direction it goes
-------------------------------------------

A d4 standard sits 4·(D−H) = 4.0251 Da above its unlabelled analyte. The
analyte's own M+4 isotopologue sits 4·(13C−12C) = 4.0134 Da above it. The two
are **0.0117 Da apart** — 27 ppm at m/z 430 — so at a TOF's resolving power
they are separate peaks and at a quadrupole's unit window they are one, and
which of those it is depends entirely on the tolerance the caller asks for.
That is why `contribution` takes a tolerance in ppm and sums whatever falls
inside it rather than assuming a nominal-mass overlap.

The direction matters and only one direction exists. The **analyte is
lighter**, so its isotope envelope climbs into the standard's ions; the
standard's envelope climbs further away and reaches nothing of the analyte's.
`crosstalk` computes both anyway, from `chemistry.isotope_pattern` of each
ion's own residual composition, and prints what it finds — the reverse comes
back as exactly zero, and a zero that was computed is worth more than a zero
that was assumed.

What this arithmetic cannot see is isotopic *impurity*: a bottle of d4
standard holds some d3 and d2, and those land 1.006 and 2.012 Da below the
d4 ion, which is the analyte's side of the spectrum. No formula predicts how
much — it is a property of the bottle, not of the compound — so a d3 shoulder
is measured as analyte and this module says so rather than correcting for a
number nobody measured.

What it is not
--------------

An infusion cannot separate isomers. Deoxycholic and chenodeoxycholic acid
are the same formula, the same precursor and the same ladder; a chromatogram
tells them apart and a spray does not, so a ratio measured here is the ratio
of everything in the vial with that composition. Ion suppression is shared
rather than removed: the analyte and its standard are sprayed together, which
is exactly what makes the ratio worth having, and it also means a matrix that
suppresses one suppresses the other and the pair cannot report that it
happened.

Measured
--------

On the nine ZenoTOF 7600 bile-acid infusions, which hold the **deuterated
standards only** — so what could be measured is the response of a standard
against itself and the size of the cross-talk term, not a real
analyte/standard ratio. That ratio and the calibration over a dilution series
are exercised synthetically in `tests/test_infusion_quant.py`, and the manual
page says so.

The three responses per acquisition are in `infusion-quantitation.md`. Two
findings came out of measuring them.

**The precursor is not a basis.** 0, 7 and 124 counts under CID against
5,235 – 12,271 under EAD, from the same vials. The ladder holds 3,839 –
27,754 throughout, which is why it is the default.

**A product-ion acquisition has no isotope envelope to leak.** This was not
looked for. The predicted M+1 of these ions is 26.4 – 29.6% of the
monoisotopic peak; the measured M+1 is **0.000 – 0.426%**, a transmission of
0.00 – 1.44%, because Q1 selected the monoisotopic precursor and the
satellites never entered the collision cell. So on every acquisition to hand
the cross-talk term is identically zero — not because the arithmetic is
small but because the instrument removed it first — and `ISOTOPES_TRANSMITTED`
is the gate that says so instead of subtracting a leak that was never there.
The correction is for a survey-scan infusion, or for an isolation window wide
enough to pass both compounds.

What the arithmetic gives, as a fraction of the analyte's own monoisotopic
peak, is in `infusion-quantitation.md`: nothing at 10 ppm, 0.018 – 0.073% at
30 ppm and 0.049 – 0.337% over a unit window, and **0.00000% in the reverse
direction at every tolerance**.

    subclass: results are saved as dictionaries and read back through
    `PeakResult.from_dict`, so a subclass would survive one session and not
    the project. The response goes into `area` because that is the field
    every consumer already reads — `PeakResult.response`, `found`,
    `build_calibrations`, the Results table's *Area* column and the export —
    and putting an infusion's counts anywhere else would mean touching all
    of them. `note` says what the number is, so nothing reads it as an
    integrated area by mistake.
