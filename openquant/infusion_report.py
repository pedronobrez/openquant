"""
One compound, infused, on two or three pages: the document that goes into the
notebook when a standard is validated.

A batch report answers what a run measured. This answers something smaller and
older: *is this vial what the label says it is?* Somebody sprays a standard,
looks at the average of the whole run, checks that the precursor is where the
formula puts it, that the fragments are the ones the structure allows, and that
the spectrum matches the record they made of the same compound last month —
and then has to put something on paper. Screenshots do not say what the label
floor was, and a bare spectrum does not say what was checked.

What is here, and what is deliberately not
------------------------------------------

The report **sums what was checked and nothing else**. Every sentence of the
verdict comes from a measurement that was actually made in this session:

- the precursor, from `precursor.measure` — the survey scan, with the
  product-ion scan as the same-ion check; and where the acquisition has no
  survey at all, from the averaged product-ion spectrum itself, said so in
  those words. Nine real infusions to hand have **one channel each and no
  survey**, so that is the ordinary case rather than the exception;
- the fragments, from whatever was run in the LIPID MAPS tab — a database
  record, a drawing of one's own, or a formula and its neutral losses. `n of
  m`, where m is how many ions the prediction offered, so the reader can see
  the denominator;
- the library, from whatever `SpectralLibrary.search` returned — score,
  reverse, matched, Δ ppm, and the record's own provenance as it was written;
- the collision energy, where the record carries one and it is not this
  acquisition's. A spectrum measured at another energy has other fragments,
  and a score that is low for that reason is not a compound that failed.

There is **no pass/fail badge**, and there will not be one. Identity is a
judgement made from evidence by a person who knows what the vial was supposed
to hold; a green tick invites nobody to read the rest of the page. Where
nothing was run the verdict says exactly that: the report is then a spectrum
and a peak table, which is a fair description of it.

The unexplained peaks are listed on purpose. An explanation that accounts for
40% of a spectrum has said nothing about the other 60%, and the intense part
of that other 60% is where a co-infused impurity — or a wrong compound —
shows itself.

The picture and the tables
--------------------------

The spectrum is drawn through `spectra_compare`, at the label floor the pane
was left at, so what is named on paper is what was named on screen; it is
embedded as a data URI, so an exported HTML report is one file that can be
mailed. Where other infusions of the same compound are open — the same name
prefix, or the ones the analyst ticked — they are drawn head to tail against
this one on a page of their own, each with its cosine against this spectrum
taken by `library.match`, which is the same arithmetic a library search uses.

Everything above is built from plain values: a `SampleEntry`, a channel, an
`Explanation`, a `LibraryHit`. Nothing here reads a widget, so a report can be
built and checked with no window, which is what `tests/test_infusion_report.py`
does. `from_explorer` is the thin adapter that takes what the Explorer already
holds and calls the same builder.
