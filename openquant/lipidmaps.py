"""
Local LIPID MAPS lookup.

The LIPID MAPS Structure Database is redistributed under CC BY 4.0 as a single
SDF. This module keeps a compact local index of it, so annotation works with no
network and answers a whole component table in microseconds — a batch of eighty
precursors would otherwise be eighty HTTP round trips against a public service.

The index is a SQLite file — 45 MB for 49,969 records — opened rather than
read: nothing is held in memory, and a name, an LM_ID, a formula and a mass
window are index lookups. The connection tables are most of it and almost
nothing reads one, so each is kept deflated and inflated only in
`LipidRecord.molecule()`.

What a mass search returns is a *species*, never a compound: forty-six
structures in the database share the formula of a DiHOME, eleven of them named
DiHOME, and no exact mass separates isomers. Treat every result as a shortlist
for a person to confirm.

This indexes LMSD, the curated structure database — every record has a name and
an LM_ID. LIPID MAPS also publishes COMP_DB, a computationally enumerated set of
theoretical species that covers more masses but carries no compound names, and
that is what the public `moverz/LIPIDS` endpoint searches. A mass with no hit
here may still match a theoretical species there; for naming components, the
curated database is the one worth having.

Six hundred of the fifty thousand records carry no exact mass in the published
file and are skipped: without a mass they cannot be matched, which is this
module's whole purpose.
