"""
Whether the mass axis moved during the run.

The survey scan is already read to measure each precursor's accurate mass
(`precursor.measure`). Done once per injection instead of once per batch,
the same measurement answers a different question: did the instrument's
calibration hold from the first injection to the last? A component whose
measured mass walks one way across the run is a mass axis drifting, and a
batch where every standard walks together is the instrument rather than any
compound — the same separation the quality charts make for response.

The reference is the batch's own median, not the written precursor: a
method value typed to two decimals is good to ±14 ppm at m/z 350 and says
nothing about drift, while the change across the run is measured against
itself to well under a ppm. Where a component carries a formula and an
adduct the exact mass is known too, and the median's error against it is
reported alongside — an offset, which is a different finding from a drift.

Measured, not corrected. Recalibrating the axis is only worth writing if
this shows something to correct, and this says whether it does.
