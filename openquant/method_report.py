"""
Everything the application can say about a method before the method is run,
on one document.

The checks exist already and each of them is reachable from somewhere in the
Method workspace: *Check method* reads the table against itself, *Fill
formulas from names* says which names carry their composition, *Repair
precursors…* says where a formula and a mass contradict each other, *Export
schedule…* says what a target cycle leaves each transition. What has been
missing is the page that holds all of them at once — the thing somebody takes
to the person who wrote the method, or files beside it, or reads six months
later when a batch acquired under it is being defended.

So this builds no new check. It runs the ones that exist, on a method and,
where one is open, on an acquisition, and lays the answers out in the order a
reader needs them: what the method declares, what is wrong with it, what it
could know about its own chemistry, which of its standards could anchor a
mass axis, what the instrument would actually do with it.

Two things it deliberately will not do
--------------------------------------

**It does not grade the method.** There is no score, no badge and no traffic
light. The closing section is a paragraph of sentences, each one summing a
measurement that was made higher up the page, and every one of them is a
count rather than a judgement. A method with eighty-two components that have
no retention time may be perfectly fine — it may be a screening method — and
a green tick on the page would invite nobody to read the eighty-two.

**It does not move anything.** `fill_formulas` writes into the cells it is
given, so it is given *copies*: the report says how many formulas could be
derived without deriving them into the method. Nothing here has a side
effect on the session, which is also what lets it be built with no window.

What needs a batch, and what does not
-------------------------------------

The component table, the findings that read the method against itself, the
formulas and the lock-mass *candidates* need nothing but the method.

Given an acquisition — the first open sample — the report can also say which
channel serves each component (`matching.match_channel`), what the survey
scans cover and which precursors fall outside them.

Given a batch — results already processed — the schedule's target cycle comes
from what the batch's own peaks measured (`sampling.py` through
`schedule.suggested_cycle`) rather than from a round number. Without one the
schedule is still built, at `DEFAULT_CYCLE`, and says where that number came
from.

A lock mass is the clearest case of the difference. Whether a standard *could*
be a lock mass is a property of the method: it needs a formula and an adduct,
because a written precursor typed to one decimal is good to a few hundred ppm
and the error being corrected is a few. Whether it *is* one is a property of a
batch: `mass_drift` has to measure the same ion in most injections and
`recalibrate.lock_mass_refusal` has to find it near the mass its own formula
names. This document reports the first and says, in those words, that the
second is not something a method can answer.
