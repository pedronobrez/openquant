mzML: the open format, so data from other instruments can be read too.

mzML is what everything converts to. A Thermo .raw, an Agilent .d, a Bruker
.tdf all become mzML through ProteoWizard's msconvert, and a laboratory that
runs more than one instrument has mzML whether it wanted it or not. Reading it
is what turns this from a SCIEX viewer into something that can look at the
rest of the bench.

Two halves:

  * a reader that presents an mzML file through the same Channel and Sample
    interface as `wiff.py`, so nothing above this layer has to know which
    format it came from;
  * a writer, because a converted file that cannot be checked against its
    source is a file nobody should trust. Exporting from the .wiff reader —
    which is verified — and reading the result back is how the reader gets
    tested against something other than itself.

What mzML does not have is the notion of an experiment. A .wiff knows it holds
81 channels because the acquisition method said so; an mzML holds a flat list
of spectra and the channels have to be inferred from what distinguishes them:
MS level, precursor, collision energy, mass range. That inference is the only
guesswork in here, and it is written to be visible rather than clever.

        every peak the instrument saw; a fixed bin width would move them. On
        that axis every scan contributes **only at the masses it measured**,
        and nothing anywhere else.

        That last sentence is the whole of this method and it was got wrong
        first. The original put each scan on the common axis with
        `np.interp`, which is the natural thing to write and is an invention:
        a profile spectrum arrives with its zero points stripped out, so
        between two peaks a scan has no points at all, and interpolating it
        draws a straight line from the end of one peak to the start of the
        next — signal at every mass in between, in a stretch where the
        instrument reported nothing. Measured against SCIEX's own averaging
        of the same 146 scans, over the same 221,847-point axis: the apex
        heights agreed, but 220,222 of the 221,847 points came back higher
        and the spectrum totalled **3.31 times** what the vendor's did, an
        extra 834,025 counts. Centroiding it gave 670 sticks where the
        vendor's average gives 424.

        Adding each scan up where it was measured instead reproduces SCIEX's
        averaged spectrum **exactly** — same 221,847 masses, same total to
        ten figures, largest difference at any point 0.0, cosine 1.00000000.
        That is the rule the vendor uses, arrived at by measuring rather than
        by reasoning about it, and it is right for a centroided file too,

        The experiments of one cycle are measured one after another, so no two
        of them share a time: the union of all the channels' times is one
        point per spectrum — 23,722 of them for an acquisition whose own total
        ion chromatogram has 577. That is not a chromatogram, it is a comb.

        A method runs its experiments in periods, and every experiment of a
        period has the same number of cycles. Summing a period cycle by cycle
        at the times of its first experiment gives back exactly what SCIEX
        reports: for the acquisition this was checked against, two periods of
        339 and 238 cycles, and 577 points.

        **Only where there is a cycle.** This used to recover the periods by
        grouping the channels on how many scans each had, which is the same
        thing for a scheduled method and nonsense for anything else. On a
        real Thermo direct-infusion acquisition that steps its isolation
        window across the precursor — 164 spectra, no repeating order, 82
        inferred channels of one, two and five scans each — the three
        distinct scan counts became three "periods", and the run's total ion
        chromatogram came back as **8 points for 164 spectra**, every
        channel's signal piled onto whichever channel of that length happened
        to be first. The total was right and the shape was fiction, and
        `infusion.is_infusion` reads exactly that shape.

        So the period comes from `acquisition_cycles`, which is the only
        thing that knows whether there is a cycle at all. A channel it could
        not place is a channel of an acquisition with no repeating order, and
        there the run's chromatogram is one point per spectrum — which is
