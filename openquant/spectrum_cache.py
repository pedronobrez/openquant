"""
Averaged spectra kept on disk, so a file that has not changed is read once.

Averaging every scan of an infusion is the expensive half of the Infusions
tab: nine ZenoTOF acquisitions spend about twelve seconds inside
`Channel.spectrum_rt_range` alone, and pressing *Measure* twice on the same
nine files spent it twice. Nothing about that average depends on the session
— it is a function of the file, the channel, which scans the spray mask kept
and whether the unstable ones were asked for — so it is a function that can
be written down.

What is cached and what is not
------------------------------

The **raw** average, as the reader gives it: profile masses and intensities,
before any mass correction. A correction is an offset applied to an array
(`MassCorrection.apply`, one multiplication per point) and it changes with
the session's switch, so caching a corrected axis would key the file's own
measurement to a preference. Corrections are applied on read, by the caller
that already applies them.

The spray mask is stored beside the arrays as the sentence it writes
(`ScanMask.ranges`) — provenance for someone looking in the directory, not
something read back: the mask is measured again from the channel's own
chromatogram on every call, because it is what the key is made of.

Where the directory is
----------------------

Beside the project, `<project>.oqcache/`, when a project has been saved.
The averages belong to that batch of files: they are found where the batch
is found, they can be deleted with it, and a project copied to another
machine leaves its cache behind rather than carrying stale arrays. With no
project open there is nowhere that belongs to, so the operating system's own
cache directory is used — `~/Library/Caches/OpenQuant` on macOS,
`%LOCALAPPDATA%/OpenQuant/Cache` on Windows, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/openquant`
elsewhere — which is the directory the system is entitled to empty.
`OPENQUANT_CACHE_DIR` overrides both (the test suite sets it, for the same
reason `OPENQUANT_SETTINGS` exists), and so does the `cache/dir` setting,
which the window passes in.

What bounds it
--------------

`CACHE_MAX_MB`. Each entry is one `.npz` of two float64 arrays. Measured on
the nine real ZenoTOF bile-acid infusions: 39.1 MB between them, 4.3 MB
each, largest 5.1 MB — a quarter of a million profile points twice over,
which is what the averages of those runs are. The default of 512 MB
therefore holds about 120 infusions, four folders of thirty, and is small
beside the 47 MB of `.wiff.scan` those nine already occupy. Over the bound,
the least recently *used* entries go first: `get` stamps the file's
modification time, so the stamp is the last read and not the write. Pruning
happens after a write, since that is when the directory grows.

What invalidates an entry
-------------------------

The key. It digests the acquisition's path, its size and its modification
time — and the same two for the `.wiff.scan` beside a `.wiff`, which is
where the scans actually are — with the channel index, the range asked for,
the spray mask's own bytes and the `include_unstable` switch. A file
rewritten in place has a new mtime and therefore a new key, so a stale entry
is never read; it is only pruned, later, for being old. Measured on those
nine with one `.wiff.scan` touched: eight hits, one miss, one entry more on
disk and the run 0.7 s longer than a wholly warm one.
