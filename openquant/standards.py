"""
An infused standard written into the method, with what it learnt and where
each part came from.

An infusion is how a vial is verified: spray it, average the whole run, read
the precursor, see which fragments the structure allows, search the record
made of the same compound last month. `infusion_report.py` puts all of that
on paper. What it did not do was carry any of it forward — the analyst read
the pages and then typed the compound into the component table by hand, from
the same numbers, with nothing saying afterwards which of them were measured
and which were remembered.

This module is that carry. One infusion row becomes one `Component`:

- **name** from the compound the file is named after;
- **formula** from whatever the infusion was actually explained with,
  carrying the labels the name declares (`CA-d4` is four deuteriums the
  formula beside it almost never spells out);
- **adduct** from `chemistry.identify_adduct` against the channel's own
  written precursor, which is the one number the instrument was given;
- **precursor** the *exact* mass of that adduct — never the written one, see
  `Identification` below;
- **fragment** the base peak of the averaged product-ion spectrum, or a peak
  the analyst picks instead;
- **no retention time.** An infusion has none: there is no chromatography in
  it. The field stays empty and `health.check_method` already reports a
  standard without a time, which is the right place for it to be said.
- **provenance**, in words, so that six months later the row says which
  infusion it came from rather than looking like something somebody typed.

Nothing here writes over a typed value. A compound the method already carries
is *completed* — only its empty cells are filled — and where a value that is
already there disagrees with the infusion, the disagreement is reported and
the typed value is kept. `Plan` holds both lists and the dialog shows them
before anything is written.

Read defensively, on purpose: a row is asked for its attributes with
`getattr` and settles for nothing, so this module holds together while
`infusion_report.py` and `library.py` grow fields of their own.
