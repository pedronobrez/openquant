"""
Molecular structures, and the fragments a bond cleavage would leave.

A molfile is a plain connection table with 2D coordinates: atoms, bonds, and
where to draw them. That is everything needed to enumerate cleavages and to
picture one, so no chemistry toolkit is involved — the coordinates are already
laid out by whoever drew the structure, and the graph work is a few lines.

Hydrogens are implicit in these files. They are counted from the valence left
over on each atom, and the total is checked against the molecular formula the
database publishes: a structure whose hydrogens do not add up is marked
unreliable rather than allowed to produce fragment masses that look exact and
are wrong.

What this does *not* do is say which cleavages actually happen. Enumerating
bonds is arithmetic; predicting a spectrum is not. Treat the list as the set of
masses worth looking for, and confirm it against a measured product spectrum.
