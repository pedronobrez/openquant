"""
Every infused compound on one row: the summary that comes before the pages.

The per-compound report answers *is this vial what the label says it is?* one
vial at a time. A folder of infusions is nine of those, and the question asked
of nine is a different one — which of them measured its precursor, which found
its fragments, which matched the record made of the same compound last month,
and which did not. That is a table, and this is it.

Nothing is measured until asked. Averaging a whole run, centroiding a quarter
of a million points, searching a library and scoring every infusion of a
compound against the others is a few seconds per compound, so *Measure* waits
to be pressed and the table stays as it was until it is pressed again. The
summary is held on the session and is never *re-measured* from a project: it
is derived from the files.

What the project does save, once a summary stands, is the figures of the
table and the averaged, centroided peak list behind every row — see
`infusion_compare`, which is what *Compare infusions…* reads back to put a
reference day beside this one without opening a raw file.

        One record per measured row, appended to the library of one's own.

        A folder of infusions is written in one go rather than a spectrum at
        a time from the Explorer: the table has already averaged, centroided
        and identified every one of them, and a record is those numbers with
        a name and a provenance on them.

        A row that proposed no compound is skipped and named, and so is one
        whose acquisition and channel are already in the file — the
        provenance in a record's comment is the key, so pressing this twice
