"""Draws OpenQuant's application icon with the suite's shared generator.

OpenQuant and OpenDIAL share one mark — the rounded square, the blue gradient, the white
chromatographic peak on a baseline — and differ in what stands behind the peak. OpenQuant's is the
*targeted* variant: one co-eluting peak showing through the front one, the deconvolution of a
known analyte. The drawing lives in OpenDIAL's repository (`tools/make_icon.py`), so the two
applications cannot drift apart; this script finds it and asks for the targeted mark.

    python3 packaging/make_icon.py            # -> packaging/icons/OpenQuant.{icns,ico,svg} and png/

The generator is looked for at $OPENDIAL_ROOT/tools/make_icon.py, then beside this repository
(../OpenDIAL/opendial). The files it writes are committed, so a build does not need OpenDIAL
present; run this again after the shared mark changes.
