"""
A clean slate between tests, because Qt and Python disagree about lifetimes.

Qt allows one QApplication per process, so every test module shares the same
one however many fixtures ask for it. A widget built inside a test is then
left to Python's garbage collector, which runs at moments Qt knows nothing
about — including in the middle of building an unrelated widget.

On Linux that was fatal. The collector freed a C++ widget the application
still had a pointer to, and the next thing to walk a QObject's children
dereferenced it: a segfault inside PyQt's own attribute lookup, landing in a
different test on every run and never in the test that caused it. macOS and
Windows read the same freed memory and survived, which is luck, not
correctness.

Proved by exhaustion before being fixed: every test file passes alone, and
the whole suite passes with each test in its own process. Nothing here is
about what a test does — only about what it leaves behind.

# sip makes for a C++ object whose Python wrapper was collected has never
# run __init__ — so the suite's teardown printed AttributeErrors from
# inside Qt's event loop and pytest-qt called seven tests errors for it,
# on Windows only. Nothing in the application reaches this: measured by
# rebuilding stacked panes in a real window, which prints nothing. A ghost
