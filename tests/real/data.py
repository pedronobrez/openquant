"""
Where the real data is, and how a test says it is not there.

None of these files is in the repository and none of them ever will be: they
are acquisitions belonging to other people, some of them unpublished. Two of
the five sets are named here because the repository already names them —
`openquant/infusion.py` tabulates the bile-acid infusions by path and the
`260904_EICs_Isabela_*` runs sit in the working directory, ignored by git.
The rest are found by environment variable or by an untracked
`tests/real/data.local.json`, so that neither a folder name nor a sample name
belonging to somebody's unpublished method is written down here.

Every accessor either returns a path that exists or raises
`pytest.skip` **naming the path it looked for**, because a regression test
that quietly passes on missing data is worse than no test.
