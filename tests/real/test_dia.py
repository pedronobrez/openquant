"""
Eight ZenoTOF 7600 DIA runs of a liver lipidomics method, 25 windows each.

They are here for two things. They are eight of the thirty-nine
chromatographic runs the infusion verdict was measured against — including the
one that comes closest to reading flat, a column equilibration with no
injection in it at all — and they are the hardest case for inferring channels
from an mzML, because every one of the 25 windows writes the same precursor.
