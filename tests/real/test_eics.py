The five `260904_EICs_Isabela_*.wiff` — TripleTOF 5600, 81 channels, 577 cycles.

These are the acquisitions every reader figure in `CLAUDE.md` was measured on:
the digest that says two builds agree, the channel count mzML has to infer,
and the one place where the two formats do not.

Nothing here is a unit test. Each one runs the shipped code over the real
files and checks that a number written down somewhere — `CLAUDE.md`'s
*Verified facts* and *Things that are subtle*, or the manual's
`measured-facts.md` — is still the number that comes out.
