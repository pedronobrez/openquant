"""
The nine ZenoTOF 7600 bile-acid infusions: CA-d4, DCA-d4, TDCA-d4.

Positive mode, no survey scan, product-ion channels only, 146 to 473 scans
each — and two of the nine that turned out not to be what their names say.
Nearly every figure in `CLAUDE.md`'s infusion bullets was measured on these:
the flatness that decides an infusion is one, the spray mask, the noise floor,
the ladder that recalibrates an axis with no lock mass, the margin against the
impostors, and the isotopic purity that refuses to be measured.

`openquant/infusion.py` names this folder in its own docstring, so `data.py`
defaults to it and the tests skip themselves when the drive is not mounted.
