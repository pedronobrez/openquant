"""
Two Thermo Orbitrap mzML from MTBLS13066 — the instrument this program has
never read a raw file from.

`CLAUDE.md` calls both of them stated gaps: the mzML reader handles them, and
neither reads as an infusion although both were sprayed as one. They are the
only files in `tests/real` that are not SCIEX, which is the whole point of
keeping them: everything above `raw.py` is supposed not to know.

They were downloaded into a scratch directory to answer one question and were
never put anywhere permanent, so these tests skip themselves more often than
they run. `OPENQUANT_REAL_ORBITRAP` points at the folder.

    A stated gap, asserted as a gap: 108 scans, one channel, and the run reads
    0.5943 flat — below `FLAT_FRACTION`, so it is called chromatography —
    because the first ten seconds are the spray coming up and only the first
    second is dropped. Given ten seconds of settling the same trace reads
    **0.880** and would be called an infusion, which is the whole finding: one
    settling constant does not fit two instruments, and `SETTLING_SECONDS`
    is 1 because that is what the SCIEX files needed. CLAUDE.md's figure is
    0.8812, taken before the reference percentile moved behind the settling
