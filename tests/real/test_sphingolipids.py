"""
The 26-injection sphingolipid batch: 141 components, 11 internal standards.

This is the batch nearly every quantitative figure in `CLAUDE.md` was measured
on — the one point per peak, the schedule, the formulas, the lock mass, the
control charts. It is somebody else's unpublished method, so neither the
folder nor the project is named here: `data.py` finds them by environment
variable.

Where a figure has moved since it was written the *current* one is asserted
and the old one is recorded in the docstring, because a number nobody can
reproduce is worse than a number that changed.
