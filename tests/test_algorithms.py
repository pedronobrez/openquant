"""
Three ways of arriving at an area, and what each one owes to the sampling.

The valley integrator is what this always did and is tested elsewhere; what
is tested here is that the other two are what they claim, that each one
fails out loud when it cannot run, and — the reason the Gaussian exists —
that its area is less at the mercy of where the scans landed than a
trapezoid over two or three points is. Those figures were measured before
they were asserted: at 14.6 s sampling a peak 14 s wide at half height gives
the trapezoid a 5% spread with the phase of the scans and the fit 0.2%.
