Guards on what the packaged application is allowed to drag in.

A frozen bundle contains whatever the import graph reaches, and the import
graph is easy to widen by accident: one convenience import of a module that
happens to sit next to a numba-compiled routine put 123 MB of llvmlite into a
247 MB build, for a function this application never calls. Nothing here tests
behaviour; these are size regressions, which are otherwise only noticed by
someone waiting on a download.
