"""
A standard's fragmentation across collision energies.

What is tested is the arithmetic and the refusing: that a profile is the
shares of its own total rather than of a base peak that moves rung as the
energy rises, that a rung's share is linear between the two energies that
bracket it, that nothing is extrapolated past the measured range, that two
activations are never interpolated across, that one record of an activation
is reported as one record, and that a record of another precursor filed
under the same compound's name is left out of the profile with the reason.

The interpolation is exercised on synthetic records with a rung that walks
linearly with energy, because the real files cannot exercise it: the nine
bile-acid infusions hold CA-d4 at EAD 12, EAD 22 and 45 eV with the
activation unstated, so within one activation there are two points and no
third to check an interpolated one against. What the real files did settle —
the shares against energy — is the table in the manual page.
