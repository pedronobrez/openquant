"""
The print themes: paper, black and white, dark.

A theme is a claim about where the thing is going — a journal that prints in
no colour, a slide with a dark ground — so the assertions here are made off
the pixels and off the contrast arithmetic rather than off the palette's own
fields. Three questions, and each is asked of a rendering:

* are the two black-and-white traces still two traces once the picture is
  greyscale, and does the dash pattern survive the halving a journal does to
  a figure;
* does every colour a dark drawing uses clear the 3:1 that WCAG asks of a
  line carrying meaning, on the ground it is drawn on;
* is a black-and-white report actually black and white on the printed page —
  no tinted row, nothing with a hue in it at all.

The label placement is deliberately not re-measured per theme: `paint` takes
its geometry from the fonts and the data and never from the palette, so the
existing measurement holds — but the picture is checked in all three anyway,
because that is the assertion that would catch a palette reaching into the
geometry. The one thing a palette does move is a label above a stick that
has grown a head, since a head is ink; that is measured below rather than
assumed away.
