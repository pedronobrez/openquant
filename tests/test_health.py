"""
Reading the method before it is run.

Every check here was first found by hand, on a real method, over the course
of a day: components that share a transition with nothing to separate them,
an internal standard for a third of the panel with no retention time,
windows narrower than the sampling can resolve. The point of the module is
that none of that needed a day.
