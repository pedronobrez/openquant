"""
A direct infusion is not a chromatogram, and is not opened as one.

There is no column: the sample is sprayed for a minute or two and every
scan is the same spectrum plus noise. What is tested here is the verdict —
on a flat run, on a gradient, on a scheduled run whose total is flat
because its peaks are spread out, and on a run too short to judge — and
what the Explorer does with it: the tree says so, the product-ion channel
becomes the active one, and the spectrum pane opens on the average of
every scan, which is then what Explain and the library search read.

The thresholds and the figures behind them are in `openquant/infusion.py`.
