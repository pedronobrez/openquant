"""
The averaged spectra kept on disk, and *Measure* taken off the window's
thread.

Two things are being tested and they have almost nothing to do with each
other. The cache is arithmetic about keys — what makes two averages the same
average and what makes them different — and the only way to be sure is to
change one input at a time and watch the key move. The worker is a promise
about order and about failure: rows in the order the files finished, a cancel
that stops after the file it interrupted rather than in the middle of it, a
file that raises being one row with the reason on it, and the buttons coming
back whatever happened.

What is *not* tested here is that either makes anything faster. That is a
measurement on real files and it belongs in CLAUDE.md with the figures, not
in an assertion that would fail on a slow runner.
