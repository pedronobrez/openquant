"""
The cover that goes in front of a folder of infusions.

The cover makes one claim the pages behind it do not: it adds nine reports
up. So most of what follows is that arithmetic — the counts, and the words
each count is reported under — built from rows made by hand, because the
cases worth testing are the ones a fake acquisition cannot easily be made to
produce: a precursor that never survived its collision energy, a method
isolating a mass the compound's other runs do not, a record found at another
energy.

The rest is what a summary must not do. It must not say "nothing was left
out" over a run that left something out, it must not point a contents list at
five pages all called `CA-d4`, and it must not print a cover over a selection
— every number on it is a number about the folder.
