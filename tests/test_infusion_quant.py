"""
Quantitation without a column: an analyte against its deuterated standard.

The real files this was written against hold the **standards only**, so the
analyte/standard ratio itself cannot be measured on them — what they gave is
the response of a standard against itself, the size of the cross-talk term
and, unexpectedly, the finding that a product-ion acquisition has no isotope
envelope at all to leak. So the ratio, the correction and the curve are
exercised here on spectra built from the same chemistry with the answer
known: `C24H40O5` as `[M+NH4]+`, its d4 form 4.0251 Da up, and a five-level
series whose ratios are 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20.

Two things are worth stating about the fixtures. The spectra are built as
**centroids** wherever the arithmetic is what is under test, because a
profile hump 8 mDa wide would merge peaks that are 2.9 mDa apart and the
whole point of several of these tests is that they are not merged. And the
isotope envelope is built from `chemistry.isotope_pattern` rather than typed
in, so a test of the correction is a test of the correction and not a second
copy of the pattern.
