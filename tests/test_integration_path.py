"""
The whole direct-infusion path, run once, with the cross-module agreements
asserted rather than the values.

Every other infusion test here takes one module and checks what it answers.
This one runs the path a folder of standards actually goes through — the
folder check, the verdict, the spray mask, the average, the noise floor, the
isolation verdict, the mass axis, the explanation, the record, the component,
the energy, the report, the cover, the exports, the comparison and the API —
and asks a different question of it: **do two modules that answer the same
question give the same answer?**

That is not what a per-module test can see. `library.records_from_summary`
wrote the run's scan count where the report's header wrote the averaged one,
and both were right about their own number; `axis_subject` folded a d4
standard's labels in twice and every module it did not touch stayed green;
`api.infusion_average` averaged the whole run where the application masked
it. Each of those was found by running the path end to end on nine real
acquisitions and putting the numbers side by side, and each is asserted
below on data made here.

The fixture carries a **spray burst on purpose**. Without one the mask
excludes nothing, `average_stable` hands back the reader's own average, and
half of what follows would pass on a build that had never heard of a mask.
`test_the_fixture_loses_scans` is the guard on that.

The figures the nine real acquisitions gave are in the manual's
`integration` page; nothing here asserts them, because they are a
measurement of somebody's instrument and these are a property of the code.
