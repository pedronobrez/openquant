The isotope pattern as evidence for a matched fragment.

Built rather than read: each spectrum here is a set of predicted ions with
their own theoretical satellites put beside them at a stated proportion, so
that "agrees" means the satellite was in proportion and "disagrees" means it
was not, and neither depends on a real file being to hand.
