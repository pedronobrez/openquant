"""
The per-region label budget: `openquant.labels`, and the two things that use
it — the spectrum pane and the printed comparison.

The rule these test is the one written down in `openquant/labels.py`: the
visible mass axis is cut into equal windows, each may claim a few labels
tallest first, and the tallest peak of every window asks for room before any
window asks for a second. What is checked here is the arithmetic, on spectra
made up for the purpose; the constants themselves were chosen by rendering
real acquisitions and are argued for in that module.
