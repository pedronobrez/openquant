"""
A spectral library read from text and searched with a spectrum.

The parsers are tested on the shapes real exporters produce — NIST's
fields, MassBank's, an MGF — and the search on what a cosine has to do:
give a record its own spectrum back at one, give a shifted spectrum
nothing, forgive an impurity in the reverse score and not in the plain
one, and keep the precursor filter honest about records it cannot apply to.
