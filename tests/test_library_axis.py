"""
Which mass axis a record of one's own was written from, and what reads it.

A record written while the recalibration was on carries peaks the instrument
never reported. What is tested here is that it says so, that a search says
what the *combination* of the two axes is and warns where a correction one
side carries and the other does not is wider than the tolerance its peaks
were paired within, that a history keeps such records in a series of their
own, and that the query can be put onto the record's axis and searched again.

Everything is synthetic, on purpose: the real infusions this was measured on
never produce a correction past the 20 ppm a search pairs peaks within — the
largest is 8.6 ppm — so the split, which is the one behaviour that needs a
big correction, could not have been exercised on them. The figures those
files did give are in the manual and in `library.axis_gap`.
