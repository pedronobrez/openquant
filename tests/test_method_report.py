"""
The method report: everything the checks already say, on one document.

The module adds no measurement of its own, so what is worth testing is that
it runs the existing checks over a method without changing it, that each
answer reaches the page, and that the closing paragraph counts rather than
grades. So the fixture is a small method built to raise a finding of each
severity, to carry one formula, to have one derivable from a name and one
refused by a written precursor, and to have an internal standard nobody
could use as a lock mass beside one who could.

The acquisition is a stub sample of the kind `tests/test_matching.py` uses:
channels with an index, a precursor, a mass range and a time axis. That is
the whole surface `matching` and `health` read, and building one here means
the acquisition section is exercised with no `.wiff` anywhere.

The printed side is opened as a PDF, because nothing about pagination is
visible in the HTML.
