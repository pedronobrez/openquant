"""
Reading and writing mzML.

The writer exists to test the reader, so most of what is here is a round
trip. That is not enough on its own — a reader checked only against its own
writer shares every assumption with it — so the cases that come from other
people's files are built by hand: seconds instead of minutes, 32-bit arrays,
uncompressed binaries, a centroided run, numpress.
