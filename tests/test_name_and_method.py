"""
When a file's name and its acquisition method disagree about the compound.

A `.wiff` written by a manual acquisition calls its own sample `sample` and
names its method `Untitled 1.msm`; nothing in it, `TargetedCompoundInfo`
included, says what was sprayed. The compound is in the file name and only
there — which makes the name a proposal, and the precursor the method
isolates the one measurement of the same question the file actually holds.

So this is arithmetic between two numbers that were both written down before
the vial was sprayed, and the tests are arithmetic too: a formula resolved
from a name, every adduct of it against a written precursor, and the same
precursor offered to the component table and to a library when the name does
not fit. Nothing here reads a spectrum, which is why the fixtures do not
bother to have one worth reading.

The four answers a verdict is allowed to give — agrees, fits another
compound, fits nothing, could not be checked — each get a test, because the
last two are different findings and a program that confuses them is worse
than one that says neither.
