"""
The name for a mass, when the mass is right and the name is wrong.

`chemistry.names_for_mass` is the other half of `precursor_repairs`: where a
written precursor and its name's formula disagree by a whole dalton, the
instrument acquired the mass that was written — that number is the channel the
data is on — so the name is what is in question, and this is what offers the
names whose formula does match.

The three cases here are the three whole-dalton rows of the real method, and
two of them offer nothing. That is the finding rather than a gap: a chain
moves a lipid's mass by 14 Da, a double bond by 2 and a hydroxyl by 16, so a
name that is out by one odd dalton is not out by a chain at all.
