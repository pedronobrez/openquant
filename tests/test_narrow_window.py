"""
Windows narrower than the sampling can resolve.

Found by reprocessing a real batch: a scheduled method sampling one
transition every 14.6 s gives a ±0.5 min window four points, and
`detect_peaks` declines below five — so the window returned nothing at all
whatever was in it, and a peak of 44,875 counts came back as "no peak above
noise". Whether a component was integrated depended on whether its window
happened to catch four scans or five, which is set by the channel's start
offset rather than by anything about the chemistry.

The window says where the apex may be. It was being used as the whole of what
the detector may see, which also truncated every peak at the boundary.
