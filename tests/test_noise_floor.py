"""
The noise floor of an infusion's averaged spectrum, measured rather than fixed.

A floor of a hundred counts is a statement about one survey scan of one
instrument. An infusion's spectrum is the average of every scan of the run,
and on the nine real bile-acid infusions the base peak of that average is
109 to 12,271 counts — so the constant is anywhere from a fiftieth of the
spectrum to the whole of it. What is here is the measurement that replaces
it: a synthetic infusion whose noise is known exactly, so that the two
estimates can be checked against the standard deviation they were built from
rather than against each other.

The synthetic acquisition is a background at a level of 5 counts with a
standard deviation of 0.5 in every scan, plus three peaks. Averaging n scans
divides the scatter by the root of n, which is the claim both estimates make
and the one the first tests read back.
