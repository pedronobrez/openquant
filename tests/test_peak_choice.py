"""
Which peak in the window is the component.

The window is a retention time plus or minus a tolerance, and it does not
always hold one peak. Where it holds two — an isomer, an isobar, a shoulder —
something has to decide, and until now the decision was always "the bigger
one" with no way to say otherwise. These tests are about the two rules giving
different answers on the same data, which is the whole point of having a
choice, and about the choice being visible in the result when it mattered.
