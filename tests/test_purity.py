"""
The isotopic purity of a labelled standard, measured from its own envelope.

Everything here is built from known fractions and read back, because that is
the only way to say a deconvolution is right: a real spectrum has no answer
key. A synthetic envelope is assembled the way the instrument assembles one —
every species' natural-abundance satellites folded in on top of the species
above it, on a profile grid at the resolving power the ZenoTOF measured — and
the fractions have to come back out.

What is checked: that the fractions are recovered within half a per cent, that
the overlap is what makes the recovery different from reading the peaks, that
the floor and the uncertainty do what they claim, that an envelope a
quadrupole has cut is refused rather than solved, that a ladder reading comes
back marked a lower bound, and that the report line and the record field say
so in words.
