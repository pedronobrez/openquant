"""
Points per peak: the one thing three other findings kept running into.

The count is made at integration and carried on the row, so the report is
arithmetic over results rather than a second pass over the files; the cycle
comes from the channel's own time axis. What is tested is that the count is
what it says, that rows from before it existed are left out and said so,
and that the recommended cycle times follow from the width.
