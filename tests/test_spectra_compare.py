"""
Compared spectra, off the screen.

The comparison is data — the traces as they were drawn, their labels and
the two switches — and the picture is made from it on demand. What is
tested here is that the picture is a real drawing at the size asked for
rather than an enlargement of a small one, that a mass shared by two
spectra is found and a mass 50 ppm away is not, and that a trace colour
chosen for a dark window is darkened before it is printed on white.
