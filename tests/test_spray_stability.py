"""
Scans a spray lost, left out of an infusion's average.

An electrospray is not steady for the whole of a run: it arcs, a droplet
reaches the cone, the needle wets. Three of the nine real bile-acid infusions
carry a transient at scan 1 of 2.8 – 4.4 times the median, and one of them
two more bursts mid-run. Averaged in, those scans are a fifth of a per cent
of the run's scans and up to 2.8% of its ion current, and they are not what
the compound looks like.

What is tested here is `infusion.stable_scans` — that it catches a transient
at the front, a burst in the middle and the scans that are still coming back
after one, and that it leaves an ordinary spray alone — `infusion.average_stable`
— that it is the reader's own average when nothing is left out, and the mean
of the kept scans when something is — and what the application does with
both: the pane's title, *Include unstable scans*, and the report's header.

The figures behind the thresholds are in `openquant/infusion.py`.
