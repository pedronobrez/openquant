"""
The peaks nothing explained, given a formula to try and a name where there
is one.

Every mass below is arithmetic on a formula, computed in the test rather
than typed, so a test that passes says the module agrees with `chemistry`
and not that two constants were copied from the same place. The one
exception is the phthalate, which is a tabulated background mass and is
meant to be compared against the table.

What is checked is the shape of the answer: a satellite of an ion that was
matched beats a composition, a composition is offered only from atoms the
precursor has, and a mass needing an atom the precursor has not got comes
back refused rather than approximated.
