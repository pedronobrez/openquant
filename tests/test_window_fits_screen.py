"""
The window has to fit on the screen, and go on fitting.

The main window's least size was 2,000 by 864 pixels on a laptop screen with
1,512 by 913 to give: thirteen buttons in a row set the Method workspace's
minimum width, the LIPID MAPS panel set the dock's height, and a widget's
minimum reaches the window. So the window could not be made narrower than the
screen, and every layout change — changing Columns or Rows in the peak review
grid, which is done constantly — re-applied that minimum and pushed the window
back out over the edge.

These tests assert the two halves of the answer: a bar of controls wraps
instead of demanding its whole width, and the window clamps itself to the
screen whatever it was saved at.
